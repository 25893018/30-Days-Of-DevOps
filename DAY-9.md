# DAY-9 | KUBERNETES PART-1

## Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and flexible environment for running and managing container workloads.

## Key Concepts

### Containers

Containers are lightweight and isolated units that package an application and its dependencies, allowing for consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments.

### Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes that host containerized applications. It acts as the underlying infrastructure where your applications run.

### Pods

Pods are the smallest and most basic unit in Kubernetes. They encapsulate one or more containers and share the same network namespace and storage volumes. Pods are scheduled onto nodes and are the building blocks of your application deployments.

### Services

Services provide a stable network endpoint to access a group of pods. They enable load balancing and service discovery within the cluster, allowing applications to communicate with each other.

### Replication Controllers and Replica Sets

Replication Controllers and Replica Sets ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times, helping to maintain the desired state of the application.

### Deployments

Deployments provide a higher-level abstraction for managing rolling updates and rollbacks of application deployments. They make it easier to define and manage the desired state of your application over time.

### ConfigMaps and Secrets

ConfigMaps and Secrets allow you to externalize configuration and sensitive information from your application containers. They provide a way to manage environment-specific settings without modifying the container images.

### Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage for pods. They allow data to persist beyond the lifespan of a pod and enable data sharing between containers.

## Architecture

Kubernetes follows a master-worker architecture. The master components include the API server, controller manager, and scheduler, which collectively manage and control the cluster. The worker nodes, also known as minions, host the application workloads in the form of pods.

## Benefits of Kubernetes

- **Scalability:** Kubernetes scales applications horizontally by adding or removing pod replicas based on demand.
- **High Availability:** It provides built-in mechanisms to ensure that your applications are highly available by distributing them across multiple nodes.
- **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers and replaces unhealthy pods, ensuring the desired state is maintained.
- **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:** Deployments enable seamless rolling updates of application versions and facilitate easy rollbacks in case of issues.
- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Kubernetes services allow applications to discover and communicate with each other, distributing traffic evenly across pods
